      <h1><p><b>NCC </b></p></h1><p>
        The NCC in India was formed in 1948. It can be traced back to the "University Corps", which was Created Under the Indian Defence Act 1917, with the objective to make up for a shortage of personnel in the Army. In 1920, when the Indian Territorial Act was passed, the ‘University Corps’ was replaced by the University Training Corps (UTC). The aim was to raise the status of the UTC and make it more attractive to the youth. UTC Officers and cadets wear Army uniform. It was a significant step towards the 'Indianisation' of the Indian armed forces. It was renamed the UOTC so the National Cadet Corps can be considered a successor to the University Officers Training Corps (UOTC)
